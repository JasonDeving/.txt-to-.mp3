I'm playing PS5 all day, got no time for these girls
They just tryna distract me from my virtual world
My controller's in my hand, my eyes glued to the screen
Gotta level up, gotta be the best, know what I mean?
I'm like Eminem with the rhymes, but my beats are fresh and new
I got my PS5, and that's all I need to do
I'm spittin' fire on the mic, like I'm playing Call of Duty
These girls don't understand, gaming's my passion, it's my duty

PS5 over girls, that's the way it's gonna be
I'll take my console over any chick, you see
I'll never leave my PS5, it's my ride or die
Gaming's my life, it's the reason I'm alive

I'm online with my friends, we're taking on the world
In the game, we're unstoppable, our skills unfurled
I don't need no girlfriend, my PS5's my bae
It's always there for me, no matter what, night or day
These girls, they come and go, but my console's forever
I'll never give it up, no, never say never
I'm the king of the game, with my PS5 by my side
These girls, they can't touch me, I'm on a different vibe

PS5 over girls, that's the way it's gonna be
I'll take my console over any chick, you see
I'll never leave my PS5, it's my ride or die
Gaming's my life, it's the reason I'm alive

I'm blazing through these levels, like a pro, like a champ
I'm in my own world, my mind's in a trance
These girls, they can't understand, the passion I feel
For my PS5, for the game, it's so real
I'll never leave my console, it's my true love
I'll keep playing, keep grinding, until I rise above
These girls, they're just a distraction, a mere temptation
My PS5's my main squeeze, my ultimate salvation

PS5 over girls, that's the way it's gonna be
I'll take my console over any chick, you see
I'll never leave my PS5, it's my ride or die
Gaming's my life, it's the reason I'm alive

So if you see me gaming, don't try to interfere
My PS5's my lifeline, it's my reason to be here
I'll never let it go, it's my one true love
PS5 over girls, that's the way it's gotta be, that's what's up!
